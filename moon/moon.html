       <h1>Love Planet</h1>
       <p>     After only a single season on air, this morning ABC announced that it would be cancelling their Love Island spinoff, Love Planet, after low ratings, budgetary concerns, and logistical challenges plagued the first reality dating show to take place on the moon.</p>

       <p>Love Planet was projected to be a hit after heavy marketing by abc and the pilot episode shattering network records for ratings.</p>

       <p>Viewers, however, quickly came to realize that a dating show on the moon was less fun than one on Earth, a place where contestants and participants could strip down at any moment.</p>

      <p>Love Island, known for its cheeky banter, 24-hour-a-day bathing suit attire, and idiotic contestants, is a hit both in the UK and Australia. So with the release of Love Planet, its success was contingent on the ability to recreate these elements - to disastrous results.</p>

      <p>By only the second episode, two contestants had died after taking off their helmets to kiss each other. And as the season went on, the couples failed to build meaningful relationships. We wish our condolences to the deceased and their families, and hope the newly single sexy young adults will find love elsewhere, if not the moon.</p>

      <p>“We thought that the once in a lifetime opportunity of sitting down with a person with such a unique environment would bring the couples together,” said host and producer Chris Harrison. “But unfortunately, the moon simply provided no atmosphere for a good date.” </p>

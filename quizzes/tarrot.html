Stop being such a Basic Betty! In order to overcome your stupidity, you need to get yank that stick out of your ass.<br>Do drugs, suck a dick at a gloryhole, maybe shove the stick you yanked outta your ass up your urethra, anything at all to exit your comfort zone. Stop being a dumb fat pussy and live a life worthy of getting placed on the Epstein’s Island."; //display result

Instead of doing that (because you’re a fucking pussy), you internalize all your pain and as a coping mechanism, have gotten really fucking good at badminton. You almost got on the Varsity Team in High School but got involuntarily admitted to the psych ward. Oops!<br>The Hermit is an earth sign card and, like the earth, so if you go unchecked you’ll start wildin with mushrooms and weeds. But also like the earth, your life is going to rot eventually. You’re the “asexual” (actually very horny, just no prospect of ever having a partner) friend that everyone goes to for relationship advice. You’re consistently left off the invite list, even to parties hosted by your roommates at your own apartment. You’ve got a good head on your shoulders and just because you may want to chop it off with a guillotine, remember that the guillotine is reserved for the rich. You are poor. Even if you wanted to kill yourself, you can’t get high in hell (mostly because of the pressure difference) but that doesn’t mean you can’t try!"; //display result

Instead of radiating dumb bitch energy, you radiate bad bitch energy AND dumb bitch energy. Your pussy is the main course of the Thanksgiving meal and everyone asks for seconds. The Elephant’s element is earth and you’re a down to earth bimbo. You’re the supporting actress, the angsty and quirky secondary character that everyone likes better than the main character. You live your life unapologetically and without regrets, sometimes getting into knife fights in alleys and Fight Club style brawls. If you don’t take your mortality seriously, you will surely perish within a year. Your motto for drinking and doing drugs is: you’ve got spirits, yes you do, when you drop acid, you take 2!"; //display result

Sorry, but if you got The Twin Towers that means you probably manifested 9/11, causing history to write itself anew. No one associates with you, in fact, most people wish you perished in a cave all alone. Not to crush your little fantasy but all those whirlies were because people hated you, not because you enjoyed having your head smashed into the bottom of a toilet bowl. The Twin Towers is a fire elemental card which makes sense because just like American Airlines Flight 11, you’re setting everything you touch ablaze. Perhaps there’s five little men inside your skull making you do all those awful things (I know about those animals you used to torture as a kid, you sick fuck), but honestly it’s probably just the way you’re wired. You are the problem. Maybe instead of checking your stepdad for prostate cancer four times a day, you can start therapy or mood stabilizers or kickboxing… anything to redirect some of that aggression."; //display result

          <p>In order to achieve a higher self, many religious sects practice asceticism. Gaping your third eye to the higher consciousness is a prerequisite for any of our reading materials, because you open yourself to the secret knowledge of the universe while cleansing your chakras of false truths. Here at Plague Magazine, we've had several people write-in regarding their ascetic experiences to achieve this higher state of mind. We hope this page serves as a guiding light on your journey to opening your mind and accepting greater truths.</p>

          <h1>My No Nut November at the Circus</h1>
          <p>On November 1st, I donned a shiny purple cock ring on my shlong. At the behest of my colleagues, I decided to participate in No Nut November, but my job at the circus requires me to remain erect at least 8 hours a day. I went to the local sex shop, and the ring winked at me from a shelf, shining like an opalescent gem.</p>
	        <p>I’m a respectable guy -- I was recently made a finalist for Guy Whose Penis They Throw Rings On at the circus. Working at the circus requires a lot of discipline. You don’t just go from rings to horseshoes on day one. Plus, there’s a lot of fun and goofy stuff at circuses, like monkeys playing instruments and women eating cotton candy, which distracts me from maintaining my monstrous erection.</p>
	        <p>That’s why I thought I had this whole No Nut November thing in the bag. So, I thought, I’ll cheat a little. I know it wasn’t right, but I didn’t think it was such a big deal. When I bought that shiny purple cock ring, I didn’t realize just how top-of-the-line that little device was. It came Facebook-enabled, with Alexa pre-installed, and by golly, that cock ring was going to hold me to my promise.</p>
	        <p>I was alone in my circus trailer. I just saw a four-titted woman, so I was feeling particularly horny that evening. Peeking out of my red-and-white striped curtains to make sure no one was watching, I felt myself giving in to temptation. I unzipped my pants, my heart pounding in anticipation as I took the little top hat off of my penis. It had been two weeks since November 1st. The cock ring glinted in the shadows, but I paid it no mind. I was so naive. At first tug, I felt a whoosh. The ring suddenly lit up bright red, tightening impossibly upon my weiner. I exclaimed as my balls shriveled in pain. Some people might be into that sort of thing, but personally, I just think it’s rude and unsexy.</p>
	        <p>I was nursing my damaged testicles when I heard a shrill voice from the corner of the trailer. I jumped, cupping my now flaccid penis in shame. </p>
	        <p>“Who’s there?!” I shouted.</p>
	        <p>The figure in the corner gave no response, only making strange grunting noises and occasional shrill yelps of what I can only presume to be somewhere between pleasure and pain. But I was unafraid -- after all, I’m a circus man, and pain and pleasure is my specialty.</p>
	        <p>I threw on the lights, and I was confronted by none other than the face of Mark Zuckerberg, his forked tongue trailing below his chin as he masturbated furiously. I was horrified. Don’t get me wrong, we love sexual deviancy in the circus community, but consent is key. That’s why we famously excommunicated Louis C.K., leaving him to pursue a middling career in standup -- which we all know is just a lamer and stupider version of being a circus freak. Plus, you make way less money. </p>
	        <p>“You broke your promise,” said Mark, still jerking.</p>
	        <p>“Dude, stop,” I said. My penis was now retracting inside my body.</p>
	        <p>“No nut november, bro. You promised.”</p>

            <h1>Foreword:</h1>
            <p>In order to achieve a higher self, many religious sects practice asceticism. Gaping your third eye to the higher consciousness is a prerequisite for any of our reading materials, because you open yourself to the secret knowledge of the universe while cleansing your chakras of false truths. Here at Plague Magazine, we've had several people write-in regarding their ascetic experiences to achieve this higher state of mind. We hope this page serves as a guiding light on your journey to opening your mind and accepting greater truths.</p>

            <h1>My No Nut November at the Circus</h1>
            <p>On November 1st, I donned a shiny purple cock ring on my shlong. At the behest of my colleagues, I decided to participate in No Nut November, but my job at the circus requires me to remain erect at least 8 hours a day. I went to the local sex shop, and the ring winked at me from a shelf, shining like an opalescent gem.</p>
  	        <p>I’m a respectable guy -- I was recently made a finalist for Guy Whose Penis They Throw Rings On at the circus. Working at the circus requires a lot of discipline. You don’t just go from rings to horseshoes on day one. Plus, there’s a lot of fun and goofy stuff at circuses, like monkeys playing instruments and women eating cotton candy, which distracts me from maintaining my monstrous erection.</p>
  	        <p>That’s why I thought I had this whole No Nut November thing in the bag. So, I thought, I’ll cheat a little. I know it wasn’t right, but I didn’t think it was such a big deal. When I bought that shiny purple cock ring, I didn’t realize just how top-of-the-line that little device was. It came Facebook-enabled, with Alexa pre-installed, and by golly, that cock ring was going to hold me to my promise.</p>
  	        <p>I was alone in my circus trailer. I just saw a four-titted woman, so I was feeling particularly horny that evening. Peeking out of my red-and-white striped curtains to make sure no one was watching, I felt myself giving in to temptation. I unzipped my pants, my heart pounding in anticipation as I took the little top hat off of my penis. It had been two weeks since November 1st. The cock ring glinted in the shadows, but I paid it no mind. I was so naive. At first tug, I felt a whoosh. The ring suddenly lit up bright red, tightening impossibly upon my weiner. I exclaimed as my balls shriveled in pain. Some people might be into that sort of thing, but personally, I just think it’s rude and unsexy.</p>
  	        <p>I was nursing my damaged testicles when I heard a shrill voice from the corner of the trailer. I jumped, cupping my now flaccid penis in shame. </p>
  	        <p>“Who’s there?!” I shouted.</p>
  	        <p>The figure in the corner gave no response, only making strange grunting noises and occasional shrill yelps of what I can only presume to be somewhere between pleasure and pain. But I was unafraid -- after all, I’m a circus man, and pain and pleasure is my specialty.</p>
  	        <p>I threw on the lights, and I was confronted by none other than the face of Mark Zuckerberg, his forked tongue trailing below his chin as he masturbated furiously. I was horrified. Don’t get me wrong, we love sexual deviancy in the circus community, but consent is key. That’s why we famously excommunicated Louis C.K., leaving him to pursue a middling career in standup -- which we all know is just a lamer and stupider version of being a circus freak. Plus, you make way less money. </p>
  	        <p>“You broke your promise,” said Mark, still jerking.</p>
  	        <p>“Dude, stop,” I said. My penis was now retracting inside my body.</p>
  	        <p>“No nut november, bro. You promised.”</p>

            <h2>ADDERALL</H2>
            <p>I’ve got three papers due tomorrow</p>

          	<p>I was going to start one on friday<br>
          	but i wanted to watch tv</p>

          	<p>I was going to start one Saturday<br>
          	But my friends were hanging out</p>

          	<p>I didn’t even want to go<br>
          	But I need to keep up my brand</p>

          	<p>Down the hatch,<br>
          Just one pill<br>
          is my perscription</p>


          <p>Well not my perscription,<br>
           I bought these from<br>
          a middle schooler</p>


          <p>Actually I’m not sure how much to take</p>

          	<p>I should call my friend<br>
          	He would know<br>
          	His dad’s a doctor</p>

          	<p>Hey dude, can i ask you something?<br>
          	Wait 1  is baby talk?</p>


          	<p>You’re saying<br>
           I should do more?</p>


          	 <p>Your little sister in 4th grade<br>
          	 Is barely phased by 5?</p>

          	<p>Ok I guess,<br>
          	You’re the expert<br>
          	I’m not gonna argue</p>

          	 <p>I’ve always suspected<br>
           that I have some<br>
           sort of ADD</p>


          <p>Five down the hatch<br>
          It’s time to get started<br>
          	I’m glad I’m being smart about it</p>

          	<p>I’m really pretty smart, aren’t I?<br>
          	I guess i never thought about it<br>
          	But I really know a lot</p>

          	<p>I guess I don’t like doing work that much<br>
          	But I know how to game the system</p>

          	<p>Hey maybe gaming the system<br>
          	Is how the system was meant to be played<br>
          	Yeah I think I figured it out</p>

          <p>Where did i put my juul?</p>

          	<p>It’s 8pm and I’m going strong<br>
          	I’ll finish this up in no time<br>
          	Sparknotes? Check<br>
          	Crashcourse? Check<br>
          	I’m a data synthesizing machine</p>

          	<p>I spent 45 minutes<br>
           reading about planes<br>
          From the youtube recommended section</p>

          <p>I can easily incorporate that<br>
           into my econ essay<br>
          I’m so good at drawing connections</p>


          	<p>I never realized how beautiful life is<br>
          	I’m so glad my parents raised me to be interested in things<br>
          	I’m doing what i’m supposed to, i am where I need to be</p>

          	<p>I would love to jerk off right now</p>

          	<p>No no, gotta keep<br>
          doing my work,<br>
          there’s a deadline</p>

          <p>You know i haven’t talked<br>
          to my friend from camp<br>
          	in almost nearly a year<br>
          	If we don’t make the effort to stay in touch<br>
          	we’ll be just like our parents<br>
          	I’ll call him now I’ll prove them wrong<br>
          	This is the most important thing I’ve ever done</p>

          <p>	How are you doing, what’s been up?<br>
          	Wait actually Let me tell you about my life<br>
          	Things are so good, i’m really where I’m supposed to be<br>
          	I have all these great ideas too<br>
          	In fact, I think up so many great ideas that<br>
          	I think it would be a waste of my time<br>
          	to follow through on any of them<br>
          	I’d just lose out on more better ideas<br>
          	Anyway enough about me, how are you doing?</p>


          	<p>Oh shit your grandma died ?</p>


          	<p>What the fuck you can’t just spring that on me<br>
          	we were supposed to catch up and laugh and<br>
          	prove our goodness to eachother<br>
          	You’re completely ruining this for me, i’m sorry<br>
          	I can’t talk to you right now</p>

          	<p>Ok now that’s out of the way, I can at least get back<br>
          	to my essay</p>

          	<p>JESUS CHRIST ITS 1AM THEY’RE DUE IN 7 HOURS<br>
          	THE HIGH IS GONE MY BRAIN IS MUSH<br>
          	WHY DIDN’T I ASK FOR AN EXTENSION<br>
          	I’m an idiot, this always happens<br>
          	I knew I should’ve gone to clown school<br>
          	I’m not supposed to be here,<br>
          	I’m not interested in this shit<br>
          	Just because I liked a kurzgesagt video<br>
          	doesn’t mean i’m passionate about fucking economics</p>

          	<p>All the ideas were stupid and drugged up<br>
          	What am I supposed to do<br>
          with three pages of ideas for tv shows<br>
          That all have to do with amelia earhart</p>

          <p>Ok ok no<br>
          this isn’t productive.<br>
          Everyone makes mistakes</p>

          	<p>This will be the last time<br>
          I procrastinate ever</p>

          	<p>Yeah, i’m glad i’m in this situation! this has shown me the errors of my ways</p>

          	<p>You gotta push your limits to break them, right?<br>
          	right</p>

          	<p>Amazing, amazing<br>
          	i’ve turned a new leaf</p>

          	<p>That’s cause<br>
          to celebrate</p>

          	<p>Where did I put my juul?</p>

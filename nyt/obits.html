          <h3>Johnny Sins Will Sin No More</h3>

          <p>The nation mourns American hero Johnny Sins after he succumbed to a heart attack this fall. An incredibly hard worker, he had many occupations such as being a soldier, pizza delivery man, plumber, teacher, and doctor among many others before founding Sins production company.
          “He was just soooooo good, makes you almost magnetically attached to him,” a former student of his high school physics class recalls. “Too bad the extra credit made my ass hurt but it COMES in handy.”
          Millions of men raised a hardened erect cock in his honor tonight.</p>

            <p>It is with great sandness that we report Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has died in a horrific incident involving several extremely attractive and very hostile captive protesters. We will remember him for the many children he left behind, due to his extremely extensive and successful anti-abortion policies. Rest in peace, Mr. Ortega — there are no babies in heaven.</p>

          <p>Famous cartoon dog ‘Scooby Dooby Doo’ was put to death last Saturday by lethal injection. This came after the shocking sentence given by a federal judge after accusations of war crimes. Reportedly, after bigfoot sightings in Scottwood, Arizona, Mr. Doo tortured Old Man Jenkins using the technique popularly known as ‘waterboarding.’ Mr. Jenkins claimed he had nothing to do with the bigfoot sightings, regardless of the meddling kids. Other reports of torture methods surfaced, involving castration, ruthless beating, as well as Scooby Doo gnawing on their bones whilst still attached. The great dane’s last words were, “I ruv ru Raggy.”</p>

          <h3>The Latest Tragedy to Rock the Jewish Community</h3>
          <p>It is with great sadness that we announce the death of legendary Jew and comedian actor Jerry Seinfeld. His passing is apparently due to an unfortunate accident at Einstein Bagel Bro’s. According to official sources, the popular bagel chain has lowered its standards for their bagel counter service staff. Gross negligence led a goyish, sickly looking boy with thin blonde hair to ignore the late Mr. Seinfeld’s request for a “good jewish bagel” and instead, served him his everything bagel with lox, cream cheese, tomatoes, capers, and red onions <i>toasted</i>. The legendary comedian collapsed after touching the warm sandwich. The entire Jewish community is mourning his loss, and we ask that you give the Seinfeld family and friends the opportunity to grieve in private. There will be a public vigil held in his honor on Wednesday, January 27, 2021. The public is urged to pay their respects by boycotting Einstein Bro’s bagels, divesting from Brueger’s Bagels, and upholding sanctions for Panera Bread.

          <p>Richard Dawkins, CEO of Atheism, moral god, and master of philosophy, has ascended to heaven in a tragic accident spanning half a decade. After tripping over his shoelaces and falling into a deep coma as a result, during which time he formed an inexplicable mental link between shoelaces and black licorice, he made a miraculous recovery from a near total loss of brain function. Shortly after, he hungrily ate his shoelaces and choked to death.</p>

                <p>On Saturday Sept 23rd, famous comedian Aziz Ansari was kidnapped by notorious pedophile Johnny Bauers, who had mistaken the Babe.net cover star for an 11 year old boy. In a manifesto uncovered by local law enforcement, Bauers confessed to discovering Ansari’s “disgusting, middle aged penis,” prompting him to mercy kill Ansari and flee the scene. Bauers is still at large. Top universities at the Research Triangle are currently lobbying for the Ansari estate to donate his body to science. Resident deformed-penis-owner and adjunct professor at Duke University, Harvey Weinstein, could not be reached for comment.</p>

        <p>The nation mourns American hero Johnny Sins after he succumbed to a heart attack this fall. An incredibly hard worker, he had many occupations such as being a soldier, pizza delivery man, plumber, teacher, and doctor among many others before founding Sins production company.

          <h3>The Latest Tragedy to Rock the Jewish Community</h3>
          <p>It is with great sadness that we announce the death of legendary Jew and comedian actor Jerry Seinfeld. His passing is apparently due to an unfortunate accident at Einstein Bagel Bro’s. According to official sources, the popular bagel chain has lowered its standards for their bagel counter service staff. Gross negligence led a goyish, sickly looking boy with thin blonde hair to ignore the late Mr. Seinfeld’s request for a “good jewish bagel” and instead, served him his everything bagel with lox, cream cheese, tomatoes, capers, and red onions <i>toasted</i>. The legendary comedian collapsed after touching the warm sandwich. The entire Jewish community is mourning his loss, and we ask that you give the Seinfeld family and friends the opportunity to grieve in private. There will be a public vigil held in his honor on Wednesday, January 27, 2021. The public is urged to pay their respects by boycotting Einstein Bro’s bagels, divesting from Brueger’s Bagels, and upholding sanctions for Panera Bread.</p>

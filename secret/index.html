          I have been using words since I could talk. Anytime I needed to express a thought, an urge, a hunger, or a prophecy, I would whisper it into a square-inch pocket of air. That pillow of sound would then float from my face to other people’s faces, bursting with a gentle *puh* and enveloping them in my unremarkable voice and SAT vocabulary. This is basic acoustics. But since watching Salvadorian comedian Julio Torres’ HBO Special My Favorite Shapes, I have begun to question my entire system of linguistics, and also the laws of wave mechanics. Words are weakness. WEAKNESS. Computers speak in numbers, so why can’t I speak in the sparkly prose of acetate parallelograms? I will henceforth ❐❑❒◐◑◒◓◢◣◤◥❐◑◢◢❑❒◐❑◐◐◓◣

        <h1 id="manson">Charles Manson wouldn’t let me join his cult because I was Jewish.</h1>
        <p id="second">
          <b>Rachel’s official statement to the Anti-Defamation League:</b><br>

          I met a guy named Charlie at a party once. We started chatting and he was telling me about this cute little commune he ran and it sounded really fun. He told me he liked my deathly thin frame like a “sexy wooden board,” my long ratty brown hair, and that I especially looked like a submissive little bitch. He gave me three tabs of acid and started going off about how he was the reincarnation of Jesus or some shit. He told me about some really epic orgies he’s had and asked if I might wanna join…
          Maybe it was his charismatic personality or maybe it was all the free drugs he gave me, but I was so freaking into it. The Beach Boys started playing and he said that he knew them. He explained how if I kept hanging out with him, I’d learn to “shed my ego.” As an overly egotistical bitch (at least according to my ex) this was really enticing. Everything he was saying sounded so nice and, fuck, who doesn’t wanna meet the Beach Boys?! He was grabbing my waist when my trip started.
          This party reminded me of my Bat Mitzvah, what with all the God talk and all the “you should really take better care of your nails if you want to do coke with me and the others.” I told him about the time I lied to my mom about memorizing my Bat Mitzvah (___) and his whole demeanor changed. You’d think after he’d been staring at my flat chest all night he would’ve seen my Star of David necklace! He said he guessed it made sense since I was “smoking hot” but he said because I was a Jew I could not participate in his little club/commune. He said, and this is really fucked up, that I could only be a victim, since, “I should be used to that, what with the historical terrorization of Jews throughout history.” Charles Manson wouldn’t let me join his cult because I was Jewish, but he did say I’d be hot with a bullet through my pregnant stomach. He seemed really into that, too.

          Shiittt girllll,,,, i was swiping through your vsco and saw that you listen to neutral milk hotell? That’s so fuacking crazy I never thought I’d meet someone else who likes 90s alternative folk grunge jazz DIY folk music, you’re definitely not like the other normal girls who drink white claws and shower. I think, and totallly stop me if i’m not respecting your boundaries, that’s my number one priority, that you’d fit right in with my crew. We all wear beanies and hate alcohol and lovvvve weed, and we don’t actually know how to skate but Colin has a tech deck. We just sorta hang out, and talk about deep thoughts at art museums, and make weekly sacrifices to the blood god Zovtar. It’s mad chill, we just sorta follow the blood rituals and grab unsuspecting middle aged men off the streets, and in exchange we all get eternal youth and these kickass stubble beards that never grow out past the middle school stage. You’d be perfect, you could be the ramona flowers to our five scott pilgrims, and Zovtar could grant you the power to drain mens souls with your eyes. Def hit me up if you’re tryna hang tn, we’re finna go blast Mac Demarco at the target parking lot until someone yells at us and then we’re gonna jump them and harvest his organs. We could, like, split the cost of a lyft? I swear i’m boutta get my license, but you know how much time serving an ancient blood deity takes haha. Still, I’d love to spend some quality time w you, at an economically viable rate ;) No fatties.

      <h1 id="audition">I don't know why the Manson Family doesn't want me</h1>
        <p id="fourth">
          I can’t keep auditioning for the Manson family, it’s expensive to take the metro up to Spahn Ranch. Like, my hair is scraggly, my clothes are tattered, I reek of stale weed and pickled onions. You know, a real regular dude. What else could they possibly want? I guess it must just be because of my incredible aptitude for playing the theremin. This one night right after I got there, Charlie had us all circled around. There was Tex, and Squeaky, and Grumpy, and Sleepy, and Dopey, and Stabby, and a whole lot of other family members watching chestnuts roasting on the open tire-fire. Charlie pulled out his guitar and started laying down some real cool music. I mean, like, I really got into it. He’s some strange mix of Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Richard Nixon. So I just quietly crept out of sight and brought out my theremin and tried to join in. But, man, Charlie was pissed. I guess he had some pretty strong opinions about the Beach Boys discography, ‘cause as soon as I started playing he said “Is that Good Vibrations?” And I thought it was kind of a vibe thing he was trying to get going, so I said, “Yeah man, these are good vibrations.” Then he started trying to attack me. So I ran. There are plenty of surf rock groups that I would gladly die for, but the Beach Boys aren’t one of them.

          I have been using words since I could talk. Anytime I needed to express a thought, an urge, a hunger, or a prophecy, I would whisper it into a square-inch pocket of air. That pillow of sound would then float from my face to other people’s faces, bursting with a gentle *puh* and enveloping them in my unremarkable voice and SAT vocabulary. This is basic acoustics. But since watching Salvadorian comedian Julio Torres’ HBO Special My Favorite Shapes, I have begun to question my entire system of linguistics, and also the laws of wave mechanics. Words are weakness. WEAKNESS. Computers speak in numbers, so why can’t I speak in the sparkly prose of acetate parallelograms? I will henceforth ❐❑❒◐◑◒◓◢◣◤◥❐◑◢◢❑❒◐❑◐◐◓◣

          <b>Rachel’s official statement to the Anti-Defamation League:</b><br>

          I met a guy named Charlie at a party once. We started chatting and he was telling me about this cute little commune he ran and it sounded really fun. He told me he liked my deathly thin frame like a “sexy wooden board,” my long ratty brown hair, and that I especially looked like a submissive little bitch. He gave me three tabs of acid and started going off about how he was the reincarnation of Jesus or some shit. He told me about some really epic orgies he’s had and asked if I might wanna join…
          Maybe it was his charismatic personality or maybe it was all the free drugs he gave me, but I was so freaking into it. The Beach Boys started playing and he said that he knew them. He explained how if I kept hanging out with him, I’d learn to “shed my ego.” As an overly egotistical bitch (at least according to my ex) this was really enticing. Everything he was saying sounded so nice and, fuck, who doesn’t wanna meet the Beach Boys?! He was grabbing my waist when my trip started.
          This party reminded me of my Bat Mitzvah, what with all the God talk and all the “you should really take better care of your nails if you want to do coke with me and the others.” I told him about the time I lied to my mom about memorizing my Bat Mitzvah (___) and his whole demeanor changed. You’d think after he’d been staring at my flat chest all night he would’ve seen my Star of David necklace! He said he guessed it made sense since I was “smoking hot” but he said because I was a Jew I could not participate in his little club/commune. He said, and this is really fucked up, that I could only be a victim, since, “I should be used to that, what with the historical terrorization of Jews throughout history.” Charles Manson wouldn’t let me join his cult because I was Jewish, but he did say I’d be hot with a bullet through my pregnant stomach. He seemed really into that, too.
